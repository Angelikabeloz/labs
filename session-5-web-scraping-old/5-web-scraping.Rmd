After talking quite a bit about data formats and data processing in the past weeks, today's session is dedicated to data collection - from the web!

What we will cover:

* basic web technologies (html, xpath)
* scraping static webpages
* scraping multiple static webpages 
* data cleaning using regular expressions
* building up and maintaining you own original sets of web-based data

What we will not cover (today): 

* scraping dynamic webpages
* APIs 

# Why webscrape with R? `r emo::ji("globe")`

Webscraping broadly includes a) getting (unstructured) data from the web and b) 
bringing it into shape (e.g. cleaning it, getting it into tabular format).

Why webscrape? While some influential people consider "Data Scientist" `r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` as the [sexiest job](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) of the 21st century (congratulations!), one of the sexiest just emerging academic disciplines (my influential view) - Computational Social Science (CSS). Why so? 

* data abundance online 
* social interaction online
* services track social behavior

BUT online data are usually meant for display, not (clean) download!

But getting access to online data would also be incredibly interesting when you think of 
very pragmatic things like financial resources, time resources, reproducibility and updateability...

Luckily, with `R` we can automate the whole pipeline of downloading, parsing and post-processing to make our projects easily reproducible. 

In general, remember, the basic **workflow for scraping static webpages** is the following.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/workflow.png")
```

# Scraping static websites with `rvest` `r emo::ji("tractor")`

Who doesn't love Wikipedia? Let's use this as our first, straight forward test case.

**Step 1.** Load the packages `rvest` and `stringr`.

```{r, message=F}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

**Step 2.** Parse the page source.

```{r}
parsed_url <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne")
```

**Step 3.** Extract information.

```{r}
parsed_url %>% 
  html_element(xpath = '//p[(((count(preceding-sibling::*) + 1) = 164) and parent::*)]') %>% 
  html_text()
```

How can do I know THIS `xpath = '//p[(((count(preceding-sibling::*) + 1) = 164) and parent::*)]'` ?

There are two options: 

**Option 1.** On your page of interest, go to a table that you'd like to scrape. Our favorite bowser for webscraping is Google Chrome but others work as well. On Chrome, you go in View > Developer > inspect elements. If you hover over the html code on the right, you should see boxes of different colors framing different elements of the page. Once the part of the page you would like to scrape is selected, right click on the html code and Copy > Copy Xpath. That's it. 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/inspect.png")
```

**Option 2.** You download the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=de) `SelectorGadget` and activate it while browsing the page you'd like to scrape from. You will see a selection box moving with your cursor. You select an element by clickin on it. It turns green - and so does all other content that would be selected with the current XPath.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/selector.png")

```

You can now de-select everything that is irrelevant to you by clicking it again (it then turns red). Final step, then just click the XPath button at the bottom of the browser window. Make sure to use single quotation marks with this XPath!

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("pics/selector2.png")
```



Let's repeat step 2 and 3 with a more data-sciency example. `r emo::ji("cap")`

**Step 2.** Parse the page source.
```{r}
nypl_url <- "https://www.nypl.org/books-more/recommendations/best-books/adults?year=2021"
nypl100 <- read_html(nypl_url)
```

**Step 3.** Extract information. When going through different levels of html, you can also use tidyverse logic.
```
body_nodes <- nypl100 %>% 
 html_elements("body") %>% 
 html_children()

body_nodes %>% 
 html_children()
```
play with that yourself if you like...

Now let's have a look at three different ways to extract information:
```{r}
title <- nypl100 %>% 
  html_elements(xpath = '//ul/li/div/div/h4') %>% 
  html_text2()

author <- nypl100 %>% 
  html_elements(css = '.spbb-card__byline--grid') %>% 
  html_text2()

summary <- nypl100 %>% 
  html_elements(xpath = '//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "spbb-card__description--grid", " " ))]') %>% 
  html_text2()

```
**Step 4.** Usually, step 4 is to clean extracted data. In this case, it actually is pretty clean already, thanks to `html_text2()`. However, in many cases, we need to clean the data we scraped with regular expressions.

**Step 5.** Put everything into a data frame. `r emo::ji("musical_note")`
```{r}
knitr::kable(data.frame(title, author, summary) %>% head(3))
```

## Scraping HTML tables `r emo::ji("rocket")`

Oftentimes, we would like to scrape tabular data from the web. This is even easier in `rvest`!

```{r}
url_p <- read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)')
r_table <- html_table(url_p, header = TRUE, fill = TRUE) %>% 
  pluck(2)
r_table %>% 
  select(Description) %>% 
  head(5)
```
Another R workaround for more complex tables is the package `htmltab` that offers some more flexibility.

# Regular expressions `r emo::ji('memo')`

Regular expressions (Regex) allow us to manipulate strings based on pattern matching. Regex patterns specify a sequence of strings, either explicitly or by meta characters. While they can be a hard nut to crack, they are extremely useful. `stringr` and `stringi` are the two most common libraries for string manipulation in R.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "a")
```

Meta characters allow us to abstract from explicit patterns. These meta characters are `. \ | ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ?`. For example, `.` matches any character, except for line breaks (`\n`). `? * + {n} {n,} {n,m}` are so-called quantifiers, that allow us to match the preceding character either zero or one `?`,  zero or more `.`, or one or more `+` times. `{n}` allows us to match a pattern exactly n times. To match n times and more, we add a comma in the curly brackets `{n,}` and to match between n and m times, we use `{n,m}`.

```{r}
str_view(x, "a.*")
```

But how can we match those meta characters then? This is where it gets complicated. Theoretically, we only use `\` as an escape character. However, we also use regular characters, like `\d` for instance, to match digits or `\s` to match white spaces. Therefore, we add another backward slash to escape the meta character `\\`. To match a question mark, we would use `\\?`.

```{r}
y <- 'abc?defg'
str_view(y, '\\?')
```
Next to character classes and quantifiers, anchors match the start `^` or end `$` of a string. Alternates allow us to handle multiple cases in our pattern. As in R `|`, is equivalent to an or. With `[qwert]` we are creating a "one of" pattern that matches any of the strings in the squared brackets. To negate this and get "anything but" we use `[^qwert]`.

```{r}
str_view(x, "^a|b")
```

Constructing regex patterns can be a quite nerve-wrecking task. This [cheat sheet](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf) should get you started using them with `stringr` in R. There are [webtools](https://regex101.com/) that facilitate the construction of regexes. However, most of them are designed for regex implementations in other programming languages which handle escaping escape characters differently.

Now lets apply this on the table we just scraped. As you may have noticed, the text in the Description column still contains citation marks in square brackets. Let's write a regex pattern to remove them, using the `stringr::str_replace_all` function.

```{r}
r_table %>% 
  mutate(Description = str_replace_all(r_table$Description,  "\\[\\d+\\]", '')) %>% 
  select(Description)
```


# Scraping multiple pages `r emo::ji("robot")`

Whenever you want to really understand what's going on within the functions of a new R package, it is very likely that there is a relevant article published in the [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index). Let's say you are interested in how the journal was doing over the past years.

**Step 1.** Inspect the source. Basically, follow steps to extract the Xpath information.
```{r, eval=F}
browseURL("http://www.jstatsoft.org/issue/archive")
```

**Step 2** Develop a scraping strategy. We need a set of URLs leading to all sources. Inspect the URLs of different sources and find the pattern. Then, construct the list of URLs from scratch.
```{r}
baseurl <- "http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v"
volurl <- paste0("0", seq(1, 99, 1))
volurl[1:9] <- paste0("00", seq(1, 9, 1))
brurl <- paste0("0", seq(1, 9, 1))
urls_list <- paste0(baseurl, volurl)
urls_list <- paste0(rep(urls_list, each = 9), "i", brurl)
urls_list[1:5]
```

**Step 3** Think about where you want your scraped material to be stored and create a directory.
```{r, eval=F}
tempwd <- ("data/jstatsoftStats")
dir.create(tempwd)
setwd(tempwd)
```

**Step 4** Download the pages. Note that we did not do this step last time, when we were only scraping one page.
```{r, eval=F}
folder <- "html_articles/"
dir.create(folder)

for (i in 1:length(urls_list)) {
  # only update, don't replace
  if (!file.exists(paste0(folder, names[i]))) {
    # skip article when we run into an error
    tryCatch(
      download.file(urls_list[i], destfile = paste0(folder, names[i])),
      error = function(e)
        e
    )
    # don't kill their server --> be polite!
    Sys.sleep(runif(1, 0, 1))
  }
}
```

While R is downloading the pages for you, you can watch it directly in the directory you defined...

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/html_files.png")
```

Check whether it worked.
```{r, eval=F}
list_files <- list.files(folder, pattern = "0.*")
list_files_path <- list.files(folder, pattern = "0.*", full.names = TRUE)
length(list_files)
```
Yay! Apparently, we scraped the html pages of 802 articles. 

## (Git)ignoring files `r emo::ji("no_good_woman")`
In case you scraping project is is linked to GitHub (as it will be in your assignment!), it can be useful to **.gitignore** the folder of downloaded files. This means that the folder can be stored in your local directory of the project but will not be synced with the remote (main) repository. Here is information on how to do this using [RStudio](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/02-ignore/index.html). In Github Desktop it is very simple, you do your scraping work, the folder is created in your local repository and before your commit and push these changes, you go on `Repository` > `Repository Settings` > `Ignored Files` and edit the .gitignore file (add the name of the new folder / files you don't want to sync). More generally, it makes sense to exclude .Rproj files, .RData files (and other binary or large data files), draft folders and sensitive information from version control. Remember, git is built to track changes in code, not in large data files.


**Step 5** Import files and parse out information. A loop is helpful here!
```{r, eval=F}
# define output first
authors <- character()
title <- character()
datePublish <- character()

# then run the loop
for (i in 1:length(list_files_path)) {
  html_out <- read_html(list_files_path[i])
    
  authors[i] <- html_text(html_nodes(html_out , xpath = '//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "authors_long", " " ))]//strong'))
    
  title[i] <- html_text(html_nodes(html_out , xpath = '//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "page-header", " " ))]'))
    
  datePublish[i] <- html_text(html_nodes(html_out , xpath = '//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "article-meta", " " ))]//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "row", " " )) and (((count(preceding-sibling::*) + 1) = 2) and parent::*)]//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "col-sm-8", " " ))]'))
}

# inspect data
authors[1:3]
title[1:2]
datePublish[1:3]

# create a data frame
dat <- data.frame(authors = authors, title = title, datePublish = datePublish)
dim(dat)
```
**Step 6** Clean data...

You see, scraping data from multiple pages is no problem in R. Most of the brain work often goes into developing a scraping strategy and tidying the data, not into the actual downloading/scraping part.

Scraping is also possible in much more complex scenarios! Watch out for workshop presentations on 

* Dynamic webscraping with RSelenium
* Web APIs
* Regular expressions with stringr
* Data cleaning with janitor

and many more `r emo::ji("star_struck")`


# Good scraping practice

There is a set of general rules to the game: 

1. You take all the responsibility for your web scraping work.
2. Think about the nature of the data. Does it entail sensitive information? Do not collect personal data without explicit permission.
3. Take all copyrights of a country’s jurisdiction into account. If you publish data, do not commit copyright fraud.
4. If possible, stay identifiable. Stay polite. Stay friendly. Obey the scraping etiquette.
5. If in doubt, ask the author/creator/provider of data for permission—if your interest is entirely scientific, chances aren’t bad that you get data.

## How do I know the scraping etiquette of a site? `r emo::ji("handshake")`

Robot exclusion standards (`robot.txt`) are informal protocols to prohibit web robots from crawling content. They list documents that are allowed to crawl and which not. It is not a technical barrier but an ask for compliance.
They are located in the root directory of a website (e.g `https://de.wikipedia.org/robots.txt`). 

For example, let's have a look at wikipedia's [robot.txt](https://de.wikipedia.org/robots.txt) file, which is very human readable.

General rules are listed under `User-agent: *` which is most interesting for R-based crawlers. A universal ban for a directory looks like this `Disallows: /`, sometimes Crawl-delays are suggested (in seconds) `Crawl-delay: 2`.

## What is "polite" scraping? `r emo::ji("snail")`

First thing would be not to scrape at a speed that causes trouble for their server. Therefore, whenever you loop over a list of URLs, add a `Sys.sleep(runif(1, 1, 2))` at the end of the loop. 

And generally, it is better practice to store data on your local drive first (`download.file()`), then parse (`read_html()`). 

**A footnote on sustainability.** In the digital context, we often forget that or actions do have physical consequences. For example, training AI, using blockchain and just streaming videos do cause considerable amounts of CO2 emissions. So does bombarding a server with requests - certainly to a much lesser extent than the examples before - but please consider whether you have to re-run a large scraping project 100 times in order to debug things. 

Furthermore, downloading massive amounts of data may arouse attention from server administrators.
Assuming that you've got nothing to hide, you should stay identifiable beyond your IP address.

## How can I stay identifyable? `r emo::ji("bust_in_silhouette")`

Option 1: Get in touch with website administrators / data owners.

Option 2: Use HTTP header fields From and User-Agent to provide information about yourself.

```
url <- "http://a-totally-random-website.com"

rvest_session <- session(url, 
  add_headers(`From` = "my@email.com", 
              `UserAgent` = R.Version()$version.string))
                
scraped_text <- rvest_session %>% 
            html_elements(xpath = "p//a") %>% 
            html_text()

```

rvest's `session()` creates a session object that responds to HTTP and HTML methods.
Here, we provide our email address and the current R version as User-Agent information.
This will pop up in the server logs: The webpage administrator has the chance to easily get in touch with you.
